<p>Programming language abstractions failed miserably at being &ldquo;simple&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Humans as well as AIs prefer file-oriented systems and &ldquo;services&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The very people behind UNIX knew this.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that makes AI a &ldquo;good&rdquo;* coder is the fact
that AI uses the UNIX Shell (why no claude on cmd or powershell?).</p>
<p><strong>Plan 9</strong> is probably the best operative system for both the human and the machine.
You don&rsquo;t believe me?
Just think about every major &ldquo;good software&rdquo; in the linux land:</p>
<ul>
<li>pipewire (if audio was files that represetns data stream pipewire would be useless)</li>
<li>pulseaudio (lmao)</li>
<li>systemd (useless)</li>
<li>gtk/qt are completely replaced by shell oneliners in Plan 9</li>
<li>and many more &hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine an LLM server implemented as a filesystem, you write inside the <code>ctl</code> file and create a new
conversation. That same conversation could be a directory, you can copy it, you can move it.
Maybe a file inside can give you the full text.
The <code>ctl</code> inside the conversation directory can make you send message, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Imagine having a &ldquo;grad&rdquo; service where you can just throw tensor at (a grad directory with
files for control)</p>
<p>Imagine having gpu cluster as simple directories</p>
<p>Imagine having a db service (I just see a recent short of Uncle Bob ranting
on the SQL IR syntax as he wanted RPCs or Classes instead, but what if he
opened his eyes and take a look at Plan 9 design)</p>
<p>Java failed, Python failed, JS failed, the whole world of software failed.
(Too many) abstractions make programs worse, Plan 9 saves you from that.</p>
<p>In the end Tanenbaum was right, <strong>Linux is a terrible operative system</strong>
as it is a clone of old UNIX architecture + the proc file system which is itself copied from Plan 9.
Everything on linux seems to be a clever hack for performance rather
then a &ldquo;good design decision&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are being enslaved by the machines, we work for the machines, we want the machines
to go fast even if it makes the system more mechanical and dense of (otherwise useless) details.</p>
<p>We prefer technical debt over intelligent design even though the Moore law makes
the computing power grow exponentially (a growth we don&rsquo;t even need today, except for GPUs).</p>
<p>Rust is a form of enslavement, the programmer is enslaved by the compiler.
The whole point of Rust is to get rid of (extremely dangerous) memory errors.</p>
<p>Tecnical debt accumulation lead to the enormous codebases which of course accumulated
bugs and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The people are now rewriting the whole things in Rust, with so much effort.
Imagine that effort being put into actually good software development.</p>
<p>There are tens of millions of lines of code which are useless and dangerous and the
whole point of rust is to rewrite them altogether to get rid of some of the problems.
Can&rsquo;t you see that the real problem was the tens of milion lines of code and not
the memory errors (which are mainly caused by technical debt accumulation)?</p>
<p>What is the language AI is performing best at? <strong>Golang</strong> (the language made by some of
the people who made plan 9).</p>
<p>And guess what language the people behind UNIX and C uses? <strong>Golang</strong></p>
<p>I am guessing that maybe they don&rsquo;t like to include 1000 dependencies, they don&rsquo;t like
to play with Classes and Objects too much or j#rk off on design patterns because
it&rsquo;s both a waste of time and technical debt accumulation.</p>
<p>But then we have &ldquo;microservices&rdquo;, &ldquo;clean code&rdquo;, &ldquo;clean architecture&rdquo; etc&hellip;</p>
<p>The 99% of software (both corporate and hobby) is just accumulation of technical debt because
of <strong>poor design decisions</strong>.</p>
<p>How are we gonna fix this? By accumulating even more debts using AIs!</p>
<p>AI is a great technology I believe in LLMs and I believe even more in SLM (Small Language Models)
but in this land of accumulated technical debt it will only make technical debt accumulate more.</p>
<p>OS design choices constrain everything above them.</p>
<p>We live in the era where LLMs can code device drivers&hellip;
Do you still think that rewriting Linux in rust is the future?</p>
<h2 id="---is-ai-really-good">* -&gt; Is AI really good?</h2>
<p>by good I meant capable of bruteforcing a solution from already recognized pattens,</p>
<p>The AI at the moment doesn&rsquo;t have any architectural or design abilities whatsoever.</p>
